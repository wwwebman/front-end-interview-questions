This information is intended for Front End Developer candidates. The list includes basic theoretical and code questions.  
I hope my experience and the experiences of other developers will help you get better interview results.    

**P.S. My main goal is to help candidates (including myself) get more web knowledge. Let's improve the hard skills of the Front-End community together. Please send you Front-End interview questions via pull request.**
